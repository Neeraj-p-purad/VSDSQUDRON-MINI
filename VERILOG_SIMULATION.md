# Task: Explore Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

## Understanding Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)

Gate-Level Simulation in VLSI is akin to dissecting a digital circuit under a microscope. It involves examining the behavior of individual logic gates, flip-flops, and other components. This meticulous analysis provides insights into circuit timing, power consumption, and functionality, ensuring the design operates as intended before fabrication.

## Essential Checks: Synthesis Directory

Before diving into GLS, it's imperative to verify the contents of the synthesis directory. Ensure it includes:
- Gate-level netlist
- Standard cell library
- Yosys Synthesis Script
